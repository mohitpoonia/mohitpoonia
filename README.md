RISC-V  - Open Source
Kernel - programm to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory  
DNS - turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
ISA - Instruction Set Architecture - hardware interaction - input-outputs, registers, data types
IP Addresss- Internet Protcol
 (IPv4,IPv6)     -Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet 
                              service provider to the device 
                 -Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168
                 -Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0

SSL- Secure Socket Layer - IP Address + Port Number
7 Layers Of OSI(Open Systems Interconnection)
                   |----- L7 - Application
               TCP-|      L6 - Presentation
                   |----- L5 - Cryptography
                         L4 - Port Numbr
                         L3 - IP Address
                         L2 - Hardware Address - NIC, MAC Address
                         L1 - Digital (1 and 0)
BareMetal- Fresh Servers
Virtual Machine - created by using Hypervisor
FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Arrays  - Configurede after manufacturing
Socket - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
MAC Address - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
Protocol- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
Firmware - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
TLS - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet
Cache - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)
