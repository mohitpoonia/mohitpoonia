 - L1 - Digital (1 and 0)

12. **Switch** - connects devices in a network to each other, enabling them to talk by exchanging data packets.
13. **Virtual Machine** - created by using Hypervisor
14. **FPGA** - Field Programmable Gate Arrays  - Configurede after manufacturing
15. **Socket** - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
16. **TCP** - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
17. **MAC Address** - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
18. **Protocol**- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
19. **Firmware** - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
20. **TLS** - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet : Version 1.3
21. **Cache** - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)
22. **STACK** - Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. **LIFO** (Last In First Out)

23. Von Neuman Architecture 
Hogwarts Architecture 

24. **Debian** - Linux Software/OS Family
25. **VMware Workstation** - IT is a line of Desktop Hypervisor products which lets users run virtual machines, multiple OS
26. **VPN** - It establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
27. **Cryptography** - It is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. It is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. 
28. **Hypervisor** - It is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
29. **BareMetal**- Fresh Servers
30. **IAM** - Identity and access management
31. **nginx** - proxy server
32. **apache** - client server - uses httpd(d stands for dameon:continuously runs in background) that creates a pool of child processes or threads to handle requests.

# Cloud Concepts
### Use Cases
1. Fraud Detection and Prevention
2. Personalized Treatments
3. Online Games
### Some Terms related to Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service **(IaaS)** : Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE), IBM Cloud
- Platform as a Service **(PaaS)** :  Windows Azure, Google App Engine, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions.
- Software as a Service **(SaaS)** : Salesforce, Shopify, MailChimp, Dropbox, Hubspot
### Types of Cloud
1. Public Cloud - Anywhere on the internet : Cloud Service Provider provides the infrastructure(AWS, Azure) :: *Multi-Tenant*
2. Private Cloud - Inside the Organisation Network : Organisation solely responsible for infra :: *Single-Tenant*
3. Hybrid Cloud - Inside Organisation or Anywhere on te internet :: *Multi Tenant + Single Tenant*
## Characterics of Cloud Computing
- On demand Self-service
- Broad Network Access
- Resource Pooling
- Rapid Elasticity
- Measured Service
### Benefits of CLoud Computing
1. pay as you go
2. scalability
3. Accessibility
4. Cost effective
5. Go global in minutes

3. **Router** - a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks.
4. **Compiler** - computer software that translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions that can be understood by a digital computer's CPU
5. **Interpreter** - A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
6. **Scheduling** - It is the action of assigning resources to perform tasks. The resources may be processors, network links or expansion cards. The tasks may be threads, processes or data flows.
