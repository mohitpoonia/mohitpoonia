Here are some keywords üóùÔ∏è:

1. CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - intel, AMD
2. RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - ARM
3. RISC-V  - Open Source
4. Kernel - programm to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory  
5. DNS - turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
6. ISA - Instruction Set Architecture - hardware interaction - input-outputs, registers, data types
7. IP Addresss- Internet Protcol
 (IPv4,IPv6)     -Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet service provider to the device 
                 -Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168
                 -Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0
8. Port No. - a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.[for http - 80

9. SSL- Secure Socket Layer - IP Address + Port Number
10. Seven Layers Of OSI(Open Systems Interconnection)
                   |----- L7 - Application
               TCP-|      L6 - Presentation
                   |----- L5 - Cryptography
                         L4 - Port Numbr
                         L3 - IP Address
                         L2 - Hardware Address - NIC, MAC Address
                         L1 - Digital (1 and 0)
BareMetal- Fresh Servers
11. Virtual Machine - created by using Hypervisor
12. FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Arrays  - Configurede after manufacturing
13. Socket - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
14. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
15. MAC Address - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
16. Protocol- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
17. Firmware - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
18. TLS - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet
19. Cache - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)

20. Von Neuman Architecture 
Hagward Architecture 

21. Debian - Linux Software/OS Family
