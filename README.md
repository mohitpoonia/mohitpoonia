- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @mohitpoonia
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Cloud Computing
Here are some keywords üóùÔ∏è:

1. CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - intel, AMD
2. RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer- Closed source - ARM
3. RISC-V  - It is an ISA based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. It is Open Source unlike the parent RISC.
4. Kernel - programm to manage communication between software i.e. user-level applications and hardware i.e., CPU and disk memory  
5. DNS - turns domain names into IP addresses, which allow browsers to get to websites and other internet resources.
6. ISA - Instruction Set Architecture - hardware interaction - input-outputs, registers, data types
7. IP Addresss- Internet Protcol
 (IPv4,IPv6)     -Public IP - B/W Internet and Device, assigned by internet service provider to the device 
                 -Private IP - in a private network [starts with 10., 172.16, 192.168
                 -Local IP - [starts with 127.00.0
8. Port No. - a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.[for http - 80
                     SSH(Secure Shell) - 22
                     SMTP - 25  
                     Telnet - 23
                     https - 443
9. SSL- Secure Socket Layer - IP Address + Port Number
10. Seven Layers Of OSI(Open Systems Interconnection)
           a. L7 - Application
           b. L6 - Presentation
           c. L5 - Cryptography
           d. L4 - Port Numbr
           e. L3 - IP Address
           f. L2 - Hardware Address - NIC, MAC Address
           g. L1 - Digital (1 and 0)

11. Virtual Machine - created by using Hypervisor
12. FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Arrays  - Configurede after manufacturing
13. Socket - Software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network
14. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation by which applications can exchange data
15. MAC Address - Media Access Control address is a unique identifier assigned for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.
16. Protocol- It is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.
17. Firmware - It is a microcode or program that is embedded into the memory of hardware devices to help them operate
18. TLS - Transport Layer Security encrypts data sent over the Internet
19. Cache - a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data (temporary mermory)

20. Von Neuman Architecture 
Hagward Architecture 

21. Debian - Linux Software/OS Family
22. VMware Workstation - IT is a line of Desktop Hypervisor products which lets users run virtual machines, multiple OS
23. VPN - It establishes a digital connection between your computer and a remote server owned by a VPN provider, creating a point-to-point tunnel that encrypts your personal data, masks your IP address, and lets you sidestep website blocks and firewalls on the internet.
24. Cryptography - It is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. It is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. 
25. Hypervisor - It is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines.
26. BareMetal- Fresh Servers
